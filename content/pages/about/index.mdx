Hi.
I'm Julien, a french Data Scientist working in Paris. I help to deliver values and insights from data using machine learning. I work on several projects in healthcare, industry, public sector and sustainability. My main interests are Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning and more broadly Machine Learning with a focus on models' interpretability.

Member of the [TrauMatrix project](https://www.capgemini.com/fr-fr/cas-client/ia-traumatrix/), a multi-disciplinary ambitious project gathering traumatologists, researchers, consultants and data scientists to build a decision support tool to better handle trauma patients with traumatic brain injuries and hemorrhagic shock.

You'll find more information about my experiences in data science on the [data science page](/datascientist).

As a human being, I enjoy travelling and take pictures. A small selection of them can be seen on my [500px] (https://500px.com/juliensauvan).
